Release Notes

Changes

Version 1.0.6, 22 October 2007

* changed License to "Unlimited" in DESCRIPTION in response 
  to request from CRAN

Version 1.0.5, 22 January 2007

* many changes to prepare for submission to CRAN

* created full documentation in .Rd format

* net.arcinput has additional argument "lineformat" to indicate 
  whether lines are in S/R format or Arc generate format; also 
  now will take R objects as AAT and lines input rather than 
  files

* added read.arcgenlin() to convert Arc generate format to 
  S/R format

* reference added for autocorrelation algorithm

* net.autocorr.onelag now returns list with autocorrelation 
  coefficient and number of pairs used to compute it

* net.group changed to eliminate "x" argument; redundant 
  with "segatt"

Version 1.0.4, 16 November 2006

* function net.interp added as inverse distance interpolation 
  mechanism for sparse data on the network

* net.addatt, net.autocorr.att, net.interp now add sid's as 
  names when returning vector

Version 1.0.3, 4 May 2006

* net.morans.i changed in name only to net.autocorr.onelag in 
  order to protect the guilty who misnamed it (Moran's I is a 
  slightly different statistic)

Version 1.0.2, 28 March 2006

* net.dist changed to eliminate confusing negative distances; 
  now up is row to column, down is column to row; very simple

* net.total.dist, net.dir, net.prox changed to use new distance 
  matrix

* net.dist changed to put net$segs$sid as row and column names of 
  output matrix

* net.group changed to delete NAs in quantile or equalInterval
  (NA is returned as value of group for those segments)

* net.map changed to draw segment with NA value as lwd=1, col="black"

Version 1.0.1, 15 March 2006

* net.lengths and net.shortlengths fixed to properly access coordinates 
  in subfunction getlength when segs$sid are not dense (1:n).

* net.map changed to use greater of net line coordinate bounds and 
  outline coordinate bounds to allow net to extend beyond outline.
  Also added lwd capability when just drawing net without classes.

* net.write and net.read added to allow writing and then reading 
  back in a network in R tables format.  Large networks in arc/info 
  format will input faster using this facility (once they have been 
  read in using net.arcinput and saved with net.write).

Version 1.0.0, 3 March 2006

* net.lengths returns vector of lengths instead of adding to net$segs,
  however net.qmodel, net.arcinput, and net.addsegs put their 
  lengths in net$segs, so result is same.

* net.addsegs modified to include dist argument and option "Gamma" 
  in addition to "Uniform".  Bug for min=0 fixed.  Changes by Leibo.

* net.dist totally rewritten to create upstream/downstream distance 
  matrix.

* net.total.dist is new function to produce symmetric total distance 
  matrix disregarding upstream/downstream.

* net.dir is new function to produce direction matrix corresponding 
  to, and to be used with, net.total.dist.

* net.prox rewritten to use new distance matrix and return up or 
  down or both neighborhoods on coordinates or segments.

* net.maxupslope is new function to create segment by segment matrix 
  containing maximum upstream slope between two segments.

* net.correlogram is new function to calculate network correlogram 
  for a segment attribute.

* net.morans.i is new function to calculate Moran's I coefficient 
  for a segment attribute.

* net.autocorr.att is new function to create new attribute with 
  at least a specified level of network spatial autocorrelation.

* net.map improved to handle colors better and to plot text of 
  segment attribute sent as vector as well as field in net$segs.

* net.map.key is new function to draw legends for net.map.
