Description: Functions with example data for creating, importing, attributing,
 analyzing, and displaying stream networks represented as binary trees.  Capabilities
 include upstream and downstream distance matrices, stochastic network generation,
 segmentation of network into reaches, adding attributes to reaches with specified
 statistical distributions, interpolating reach attributes from sparse data,
 analyzing autocorrelation of reach attributes, and creating maps with legends
 of attribute data.  Target applications include dynamic fish modeling.
